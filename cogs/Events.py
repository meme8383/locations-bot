Having grown up in SLT, I've had a lot of time to familiarize the area's land/structures and specific details which make them unique. 
While I no longer live in Tahoe, I'm able to visit often and hold a sense of nostalgia which provides motivation to continue the project. 
On top of my area's knowledge, I have been an active player of Minecraft for nearly 8 years; giving me lots of experience on the game's building techniques. 
Overall, I believe my experience could help to finish another area on the map and I would enjoy being a part of the community. 
Thank you for taking the time to review my application."""
